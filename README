Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::OpenID

Just say "no" to document drift. See the POD for any details,
including copyright and licence, beyond installation.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

It is recommended that you try to install with TEST_HTTP set to a true
value in your environment. If it is set, the tests will run a forking
test server which acts as an OpenID provider and consumer to run tests
within a test Catalyst application. Failure here doesn't guarantee the
module won't work for you but success pretty much guarantees it will
work.
