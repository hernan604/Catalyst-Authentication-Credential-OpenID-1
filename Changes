Revision history for Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::OpenID

0.06  Thu Jul  3 17:20:39 PDT 2008
      - All CPAN reports for 0.05 are failing. Added Catalyst::Devel and
        Catalyst to prereqs. It was just Catalyst::Runtime before.
      - Also changed around Test App storage a bit to avoid permission
        errors on tmp cache file from different user runs.

0.05  Wed Jul  2 20:17:21 PDT 2008
      - Removed UNIVERSAL::require to shrink prereqs and protect
        namespaces.
      - Turned on test app tests. I want to know if it's failing for
        others.
      - Swapped LWPx::ParanoidAgent for LWP::UA in the test.
